    "Experienced Senior Frontend Developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript. I'm also well-versed in utilizing libraries like React and frameworks like Next.js to create modern web applications.",
    "My coding journey began long ago when I became intrigued with doing MySpace page makeovers, which eventually led me to start designing and building custom websites for local businesses. I continued to sharpen my skills as a freelancer and years later I was hired as a professional web developer for a small agency in New Orleans called Deep Fried Advertising, where I provide a wide array of web solutions.",
    "When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending time with my wife and son, cheering for my favorite sports teams (Razorbacks, Pelicans, and Saints), and savoring the tastiest plant-based food available."
